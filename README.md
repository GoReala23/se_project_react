# WTWR (What To Wear) Application

The "What To Wear" (WTWR) application is a dynamic, user-friendly web platform developed with React. It leverages live weather data to recommend the most suitable clothing options for current weather conditions, ensuring users are appropriately dressed for any weather.

## Key Features

- **Live Weather Updates**: Utilizes the OpenWeather API to display real-time weather information, including temperature, condition, and the user's location.

- **Automated Clothing Recommendations**: Dynamically suggests clothing items from a predefined list based on the live weather data, aiding users in making quick and efficient outfit decisions.

- **Interactive Clothing Catalog**: Features an interactive catalog where users can explore different clothing options. Clicking on a clothing item brings up a detailed view in a modal, enhancing user interaction.

- **Custom Clothing Addition**: Allows users to contribute to the platform by adding new clothing items, complete with name, image, and associated weather condition, enriching the application's database and community engagement.
